Issues
======
-ConstructionMenuSelection uses a method [ChangeSelection()] instead of an event to inform BuildingManager what something was selected. 
-To properly update ResourcePanel, I probably need an Event: OnChangedResourceValue or something, so it will only update when necessary
-Hmm, probably gonna need to convert resources into separate classes, for modularity and stuff

-BuildingDecoy snap to grid doesn't work

-BuildingDecoy turns green even if you don't have enough resources

TODO

-water animations
